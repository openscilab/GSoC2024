PyCM is a multi-class confusion matrix library written in Python that supports both input data vectors and direct matrix, and a proper tool for post-classification model evaluation that supports most classes and overall statistics parameters. The project has been developed for six years and matured enough. Now there is time to add new features enlarging the library scope. Below are multiple ideas regarding this project with a title and a short description fetched from our backlog. Each of these ideas could have some tasks. Based on our evaluation, for each contributor it will take 3.5 month (nearly what GSoC is also planned to) to take care of each idea. 

### Dissimilarity Matrix
A dissimilarity matrix quantifies the dissimilarity between pairs of objects in a dataset. Refer to [here](https://www.statistics.com/glossary/dissimilarity-matrix/) for more information. The idea is to add support of dissimilarity matrix and provide a pipeline, such as what we have now for `ConfusionMatrix`, extracting different metrics.

* If you are interested into software development scaling challenges and also like research metrics in machine learning, this idea could be your best shot.

### I/O Enhancement
As time goes on, there where situation in which users wanted to import their data or get their output from a format which we didn't have plan for supporting it. This idea will target aggregation of challenging input/output formats which was desired to be supported by PyCM. Following we have our objectives for this idea.

1. Support `csv` files as input
2. Support `.md` format as output
3. Support `LateX` format as output
4. HTM format output enhancement

* If you are interested in system/pipeline design and ready to dig into parsing these formatted structure, let's pick p this idea.

### Curve Generalization and Threshold Selection

### Data Distribution Analysis

### PyCM Optimization: Boosting Performance and Speed

### Make PyCM More Accessible to Data Scientists (Documentation)

### Incorporate Time Series Analysis in PyCM for Dynamic Model Assessment

### Real-time Model Monitoring with PyCM
